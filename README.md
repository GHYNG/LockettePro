# LockettePro
### LockettePro - A much better Lockette plugin for Bukkit

This variation of LockettePro is a fork of [brunyman's version](https://github.com/brunyman/LockettePro/tree/master),
which is a fork of [connection_lost's version](https://github.com/connection-lost/LockettePro).

LockettePro is a block-protection plugin based on Lockette (https://github.com/Acru/Lockette), the code base is entirely re-written. It is 100% compatable with original Lockette, and the plugin behaviors are also 100% same.
